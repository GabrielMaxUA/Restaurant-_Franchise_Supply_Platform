# API URL and Data Parsing Fixes

## Changes Made

1. **Updated API Base URL**
   - Changed from `http://10.0.2.2:8000/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
   - This ensures direct access to the host machine API from mobile app

2. **Enhanced API Testing for Catalog Products**
   - Implemented multiple endpoint testing to find working endpoints
   - Added better data structure detection for Laravel response formats
   - Properly extracts and verifies products data regardless of nesting structure
   - Improved logging to show exactly what data is found

3. **Enhanced API Testing for Orders**
   - Added support for multiple order endpoints
   - Properly handles nested order data structures
   - Checks for order_counts property in response
   - Better reporting of actual order data found

4. **Improved Data Extraction Logic**
   - Handles various Laravel response formats:
     - Direct arrays of items
     - Data property containing items
     - Nested data.data structure from Laravel Resources
     - Named properties like 'orders' or 'products'
   - Added extra logging to help diagnose API response issues

## Expected Response Structure

Based on your provided example, the orders API returns data in a structure like:

```javascript
{
  success: true,
  orders: [
    // Array of 4 order objects
  ],
  order_counts: {
    pending: 0, 
    processing: 0, 
    packed: 4, 
    shipped: 0, 
    delivered: 6, 
    rejected: 2
  },
  pagination: {
    current_page: 1,
    last_page: 1,
    per_page: 10,
    total: 4
  }
}
```

Our updated code now properly detects and extracts this data structure, even if the format varies across different API endpoints.

## Testing New Endpoints

When testing the API, try the following endpoints if you encounter any issues:

### Catalog Endpoints
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/franchisee/catalog
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/catalog
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/products
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/franchisee/products

### Orders Endpoints
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/franchisee/orders
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/orders
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/franchisee/orders/pending
- http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/orders/pending

## Next Steps

1. If you need to run the app on different devices, you may need to adjust the API URL:
   - For Android emulator: Use `10.0.2.2` instead of `127.0.0.1`
   - For iOS simulator: Use `localhost` instead of `127.0.0.1`
   - For physical devices: Use your computer's actual IP address on the local network

2. Consider adding a configuration option in the app to make the API base URL configurable without code changes.

3. Monitor the API logs to ensure the correct endpoints are being used and data is being properly extracted.
