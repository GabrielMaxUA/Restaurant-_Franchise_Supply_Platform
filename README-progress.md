## Development Progress Summary

**Overall Completion**: Approximately 65-70%

The project has a solid web backend foundation with most core features implemented. The key missing components are:

1. The entire mobile application (a critical user-facing component)
2. Complete QuickBooks integration
3. Push notifications through Firebase
4. Some infrastructure and security elements

The current implementation provides a functional web backend for admins and warehouse staff, but the franchisee mobile experience needs to be developed to fulfill the complete requirements.
